# WEDE-Part-2
In part 2, we were required to use  CSS style so that the website can look representable.
I have linked all webpages to the external stylesheet  and added a comment at the top of the style css
I have created a base and reset css, typography, layout, and visual style to make the website bright and responsive.
The links and buttons have also been provided hover and focus elements to make them interactive.
